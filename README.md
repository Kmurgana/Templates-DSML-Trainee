# Templates for Data Science and Machine Learning -Trainee







The objective of this repository is to make available basic templates for any Machine Learnig and Data Science (Trainee) project in Python.



The idea is to add linear regression, clustering and recommender systems in the future. So far the only thing developed is a template for categorical variables. Through SK Learn, with the cross validation and grid search method, the following models are being created

The models are as follows:

Depending on the target variable we have to predict, we have:
